title = "Nordix Foundation Code of Conduct"
+++

In order to keep the Nordix Community welcoming and a safe place we ask that all participates read and adhere to the following
code of
conduct. The purpose of the Nordix Foundation Code of Conduct is to help foster a truly collaborative community environment.

**Be friendly, patient and welcoming:** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and
identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour,
immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age,
size, family status, political belief,
religion and mental and physical ability.

**Be transparent:** Decisions should be made in a transparent fashion with due-diligence from the community. If your action can
impact others, communicate ahead of time if possible and listen to feedback. If somehow your actions negatively impact others,
do apologize. When we disagree, try to understand why: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and the
Nordix community is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember
that weâ€™re different.

**Be empathetic:** Anyone can have a bad day. Do not assume bad intentions.

No one should be afraid of asking questions or making mistakes.  Some may not know how to express themselves or may feel
intimidated, and community members should encourage people to simply participate the best they can and people will not be
judged. This is largely a volunteer workforce in the sense that many of our community members have other demands on their lives.
We should strive to create an environment that people will want to work in, as opposed to one that increases daily stress.
We need to respect differences in culture, language, and time zones.
