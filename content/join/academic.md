New Academic/Nonprofit Members will be eligible to vote in future elections.

Academic/Nonprofit membership is free. Additional details are outlined in the [Academic/Nonprofit Membership Policy](/legal/academic-policy/), the [bylaws](/legal/bylaws/), and the [Academic/Nonprofit Member Agreement](/legal/academic-agreement/).
