Academic and nonprofit organizations are full members of the foundation with representation on the board of directors. If you are intestersted in becoming a Academic/Nonprofit Member, please contact us.

At the start of their term, new Academic/Nonprofit Members will immediately be represented by the Academic/Nonprofit Directors already in office, who represent the entire Academic/Nonprofit class (not the organizations who employ them). New Academic/Nonprofit Members will be eligible to vote in future elections.

Academic/Nonprofit membership is free. Additional details are outlined in the [Academic/Nonprofit Membership Policy](/legal/academic-policy/), the [bylaws](/legal/bylaws/), and the [Academic/Nonprofit Member Agreement](/legal/academic-agreement/).
