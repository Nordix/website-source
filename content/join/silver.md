The Silver Members play an essential part in sustaining the association. If you are intestersted in becoming a Silver Member, please contact us.

At the start of their term, new Silver Members will immediately be represented by the Silver Directors already in office, who represent the entire Silver Member class (not the companies who employ them). New Silver Members will be eligible to vote in future elections for Silver Directors.

Silver Members make an annual contribution of 2k EUR (1k EUR for companies under 100 employees, or 500 EUR for companies under 50 employees). Additional details are outlined in the [Member Policy](/legal/member-policy/) and the [bylaws](/legal/bylaws/).
