The Silver Members play an essential part in sustaining the foundation. If you are intestersted in becoming a Silver Member, please contact us.

At the start of their term, new Silver Members will immediately be represented by the Silver Directors already in office, who represent the entire Silver class (not the companies who employ them). New Silver Members will be eligible to vote in future elections.

Silver Members make an annual contribution of 20k SEK/2k EUR (10k SEK/1k EUR for companies under 100 employees, or 5k SEK/500 EUR for companies under 50 employees). Additional details are outlined in the [Silver Membership Policy](/legal/silver-policy/), the [bylaws](/legal/bylaws/), and the [Silver Member Agreement](/legal/silver-agreement/).
