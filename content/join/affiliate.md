Academic and nonprofit organizations can join the association as Affiliate Members. If you are intestersted in becoming an Affiliate Member, please contact us.

At the start of their term, new Affiliate Members will immediately be represented by the Affiliate Directors already in office, who represent the entire Affiliate Member class (not the organizations who employ them). New Affiliate Members will be eligible to vote in future elections for Affiliate Directors.

Affiliate membership is free. Additional details are outlined in the [Member Policy](/legal/member-policy/) and the [bylaws](/legal/bylaws/).
