title = "Nordix Foundation Launch Dinner"
+++

Following our planned timeline, we have now established the Nordix Foundation and are in the process of forming our founding board. Our next step is to hand responsibility for Nordix to the board as they step into leadership roles for the foundation.

To celebrate this milestone, as we come together to move Nordix into an operative establishment phase, we would like to host a dinner for our broader community discussing our planned activities, potential for engagement and expected/desired outcomes for 2018. We will also discuss our communication strategy, industry engagements and plans for establishing Nordix as a recognizable brand in the Nordic ecosystem. Please RSVP if you are able to join us on the 12th at: [events@nordix.org](mailto:events@nordix.org).

We look forward to seeing you there and sharing the journey of establishing Nordix with you.

Regards,  
The Nordix team
