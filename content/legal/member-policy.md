__Application for Membership__

Any natural person, non-profit organization, academic institution, business entity, government agency, or any other legal person may nominate itself to be a new Member, if any applicable Member positions are not filled.

Members must meet the criteria set by the Board of Directors prior to applying for membership.

The Board of Directors shall consider the application of the nominee at its next meeting. If the Board of Directors approves the admission, the entity shall become a Member. All applications for membership must be approved by the Board of Directors.

__Member Obligations__

1. The Member will provide complete and accurate information on the application on the date of submission. The Member will continue to update such information to ensure that it remains complete and accurate. In particular, the Member will promptly update any change in its email contact address.

2. The Member consents to making available to the public its name to promote the Association and its operations and purposes. 

3. The Member consents to communication by electronic means to its email contact address.

__Payment Obligations for Silver and Platinum Members__

1. The Membership Fees are determined annually at the Annual General Assembly of the Association, as provided in Section 2.5 of the Articles of Association.

2. Membership Fees shall be paid within forty-five (45) days of receiving an invoice from the Association. If the Membership Fees are not paid when due, the Association may charge a late fee to the Member of one percent (1%) for each thirty (30) day period of delay.

3. Membership Fees are not refundable except for as provided below:

 * a) if termination is by the Board of Directors as provided in this Member Policy, or

 * b) the Member terminates its membership based on a material change in the purposes of the Association as provided in this Member Policy. 

In such case, the Association shall refund to the Member within sixty (60) days of the effective date of the termination the pro rata amount for the remaining calendar year during which the termination is effective.

__Term of Membership__

1. The effective date for the membership of a Member shall be the date on which the Member has been approved by the Board of Directors and – in case of Silver and Platinum Members – the Membership Fees have been paid. 

2. The term of the membership of a Silver or Platinum Member shall run through (i) December 31 of the same calendar year as the effective date of the membership if the effective date is on or earlier than July 1 of a calendar year and (ii) December 31 of the calendar year after the effective date of the membership if the effective date is later than July 1 of a calendar year, and such term shall automatically renew for one year at a time unless terminated pursuant to this Section. For example, if the effective date of the membership is March 15, 2020, then the term of such Member terminates on December 31, 2020. However, if the effective date of the membership is September 15, 2020, then the term of such Member terminates on December 31, 2021. 

3. A Silver or Platinum Member may terminate its membership upon three (3) months’ notice before the end of the calendar year by written notice to the Secretary. For example, if the written notice is given on or before September 30, 2021, the membership ends on December 31, 2021. However, if the notice is given on or after October 1, 2021, the membership ends on December 31, 2022. 

4. An Affiliate Member may terminate its membership at any time with immediate effect by written notice to the Secretary. 

5. In addition, a Member may terminate its membership with immediate effect by way of written notice to the Secretary if the Association materially changes its purposes set forth in these Articles of Association.

6. The Board of Directors may, by an affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors, terminate a membership if a Member has materially breached its obligations to the Association. The Secretary shall give written notice to the Member of the decision and the termination shall be effective on the receipt of such notice.
