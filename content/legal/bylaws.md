If such a waiver is given by electronic transmission, the electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the Member.

__3.6 Voting List.__

a) The Secretary of the Foundation shall prepare at least (i)  thirty (30) days before each annual meeting of Silver and Academic/Nonprofit  Members, respectively, or (ii) within two (2) days of the notice of the annual meeting of  Silver and Academic/Nonprofit Members, respectively, as provided in Section 3.5 (whichever is shorter), a complete list of the Members of the relevant class entitled to vote at the meeting arranged in alphabetical order for each class of Members, and showing the mailing address of each Member of the relevant class solely for the purposes permitted under Delaware Corporate Law.  Such list shall be treated as confidential.  The list shall only include active Members of the class and shall not include any Members who have resigned or whose membership has been terminated.  The Board of Directors shall develop a process for determining the right of Members to appeal their inclusion on any such list.  Such list shall be open to the examination of any Member of the class, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least thirty (30) days prior to the meeting or the shorter period provided above in the manner provided by law.  If the meeting is held at a place, the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time of the meeting, and may be examined by any Member of the class who is present.  If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, such list shall also be open to the examination of any Member of the class during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.  The list shall be the only evidence as to the Members of the class who are entitled to examine the list required by this Section 3.6(a) or to vote in person or by proxy at the relevant annual meeting.

b) The Secretary shall prepare, at least two (2) days after providing notice of a special meeting of the Members, a complete list of the Members entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order for each class of Member, and showing the mailing address of each Member.  Such list shall be open to the examination of any Member, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for the period between the notice and prior to the meeting, in the manner provided by law.  If the meeting is held at a place, the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time of the meeting, and may be examined by any Member who is present.  If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, such list shall also be open to the examination of any Member during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.  The list shall be the only evidence as to the Members who are entitled to examine the list required by this Section 3.6(b) or to vote in person or by proxy at the relevant meeting.

__3.7 Quorum.__  The holders of a majority of the Members of the relevant class entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority of the Members of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter except as provided below. 

__3.8 Voting and Proxies.__

a) Each Platinum Member shall have one (1) vote at any meeting of the Platinum Members. 

b) Each Silver Member shall have one (1) vote at any meeting of the Silver Members.

No Member may authorize more than one proxy for a particular meeting; the authorization of a new proxy for a meeting by a Member automatically revokes all prior proxies for the same meeting.  Any copy, facsimile transmission, or other reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission created pursuant to this section may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or electronic transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile transmission, or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or electronic transmission.

__3.9 Action at Meeting.__

a) All matters shall be determined by a majority of votes of the class of Members present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter (or if there are two or more classes of Members entitled to vote as separate classes, then in the case of each such class, a majority of the Members of each such class present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter shall decide such matter), provided that a quorum is present, except when a different vote is required by express provision of law or these Bylaws.

b) All voting, including on the election of directors, but excepting where otherwise required by law, may be by a voice vote for in person meetings; provided, however, that upon demand therefor by a Member entitled to vote or the Member’s proxy, a vote by ballot shall be taken.  Each ballot shall state the name of the Member or proxy voting and such other information as may be required under the procedure established for the meeting.

__3.10 Conduct of Business.__ At every meeting of the class of Members, the Chairman of the Board, or, in his absence, such other person as may be appointed by the Board of Directors, shall act as chairman.  The Secretary of the Foundation or a person designated by the chairman of the meeting shall act as secretary of the meeting.  Unless otherwise approved by the chairman of the meeting, attendance at the annual meeting is restricted to the Members of the relevant class, persons authorized in accordance with Section 3.8 of these Bylaws to act by proxy, and officers of the Foundation.

The chairman of the meeting shall call the meeting to order, establish the agenda, and conduct the business of the meeting in accordance therewith, or, at the chairman’s discretion, the business of the meeting may be conducted otherwise in accordance with the wishes of the Members in attendance.

__3.11 Member Action without Meeting.__  Any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of the Members may be taken without a meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the actions so taken, is signed by the Members having not less than the minimum number of votes of Members that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all Members entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.  All such consents shall be filed with the Secretary and shall be maintained in the corporate records.  Prompt notice of the taking of a corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those Members of the relevant class who have not consented in writing.

An electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a Member, or by a proxy holder or other person authorized to act for a Member, shall be deemed to be written, signed, and dated for the purpose of this Section 3.11, provided that such electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the Foundation can determine (a) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the Member or by a person authorized to act for the Member and (b) the date on which such Member or authorized person transmitted such electronic transmission.  The date on which such electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed.  No consent given by electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be delivered to the Foundation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or the Secretary, an officer or agent of the Foundation having custody of the books in which proceedings of meetings of the Members are recorded.

__3.12 Meetings by Remote Communication.__ If authorized by the Board of Directors, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board may adopt, Members and proxy holders not physically present at a meeting of Members may, by means of remote communication, participate in the meeting and be deemed present in person and vote at the meeting, whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, provided that a) the Foundation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a Member or proxy holder, b) the Foundation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such Members and proxy holders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the Members, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and c) if any Member or proxy holder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the Foundation.

Unless otherwise indicated in the notice thereof, any and all business may be transacted at a special meeting.

__4.8 Participation in Meetings by Telephone Conference Calls or Other Methods of Communication.__ Directors or any members of any committee designated by the directors may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or such committee by means of conference, telephone, or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

__4.9 Quorum.__ A majority of the total number of directors in office shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of the Board of Directors.  In the absence of a quorum at any such meeting, a majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.  Interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or at a meeting of a committee which authorizes a particular contract or transaction.

__4.10 Action at Meeting.__ At any meeting of the Board of Directors at which a quorum is present, the vote of a majority of those present shall be sufficient to take any action, unless a different vote is specified by law or these Bylaws.

__4.11 Action by Written Consent.__ Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be, consent to the action in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writings or electronic transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee.  Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form.

__4.12 Committees.__ The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Foundation with such lawfully delegated powers and duties as it therefor confers, to serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors may also appoint advisory committees which may be composed of members of the Board of Directors, non-members of the Board of Directors, or a combination of both types of individuals; provided that the advisory committees shall provide advice to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors may not delegate its authority to such an advisory committee.  The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee.  Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors and subject to the provisions of the Delaware Corporate Law, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Foundation and may authorize the seal of the Foundation to be affixed to all papers which may require it.  Each such committee shall keep minutes and make such reports as the Board of Directors may from time to time request.  Except as the Board of Directors may otherwise determine, any committee may make rules for the conduct of its business, but unless otherwise provided by such rules, its business shall be conducted as nearly as possible in the same manner as is provided in these Bylaws for the Board of Directors.

__4.13 Director Diversity.__

a) The Foundation wishes to ensure that the Platinum Members and Silver Members are represented independently on the Board of Directors and avoid compromising such independence because of business relationships, mergers or other transactions.  This independence shall be implemented by limiting the relationships between the Members and the Board of Directors.  No more than one Director from an Affiliated Group shall serve on the Board of Directors at the same time (the “Director Diversity Requirement”).  

b) The term “Affiliated” or “Affiliation” is defined as relationships between Members and individuals who are Directors, the individual being a; (i) board member, officer or employee to either of the Member or its Affiliated Group (as defined below), or (ii) an independent contractor to either of the Member or its Affiliated Group who has earned more than $60,000 in the most recent twelve (12) month period.  The final determination of Affiliation shall be made by the Board of Directors without the vote of the directors who are alleged to have been Affiliated.

c) An Affiliated Group means that for Members that are business entities, one entity is “Controlled” by the other entity.  “Controlled” or “Control” means one entity owns, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting securities of the Controlled entity which vote for the election of the Board of Directors or other managing body of an entity, or which is under common control with the Controlled entity.

d) No director may take office if the addition of the director would cause a violation of the Director Diversity Requirement. If the new director is a Platinum Director, the Platinum Member making such appointment shall make the determination of which other director shall resign from the Board of Directors. If the designated director does not resign, the Chief Executive Officer shall call a special meeting of the relevant class of Members.  If the new director is a Silver Class Director, the Silver Class Members shall elect a new individual to serve as the Silver Class Director at a special meeting of the Silver Members.  If the new director is an Academic/Nonprofit Class Director, the Academic/Nonprofit Members shall elect a new individual to serve as the Academic/Nonprofit Class Director at a special meeting of the Academic/Nonprofit Members.

e) If a Director becomes Affiliated during his or her term and such Affiliation violates the Director Diversity Requirement, such individual shall resign as a Director. 

f) A violation of the Director Diversity Requirement may be waived by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors (i.e. not including the directors who are Affiliated).

__4.14 Compensation of Directors.__ Directors shall not be entitled to compensation or reimbursement of expenses.  No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the Foundation in any other capacity and receiving compensation for such service.

__4.15 Technical Committee.__ The Board of Directors shall appoint the members of the Technical Committee for terms to be determined by the Board of Directors. The Technical Committee shall have the authority and responsibility to govern the technical activity of the foundation, as delegated by the Board of Directors. Except as expressly provided in these Bylaws, the Technical Committee shall determine its process and procedures, provided that such process and procedures must be published in a manner that they are readily accessible to all Members of the Foundation.

## ARTICLE X. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

__10.1 Right to Indemnification.__ Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (“proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or a person of whom he is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Foundation or, is or was serving at the request of the Foundation as a director or officer of another entity, or as a controlling person of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director or officer, or in any other capacity while serving as a director or officer, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Foundation to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware Corporate Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Foundation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Foundation to provide prior to such amendment) against all expenses, liability and loss reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of his heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that except as provided in this Section 10.1, the Foundation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnity in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if a) such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, b) the proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors, c) such indemnification is provided by the Foundation, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Foundation under Delaware Corporate Law, or d) the proceeding (or part thereof) is brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification or advancement under an indemnity agreement or any other statute or law or otherwise as required under Section 145 of Delaware Corporate Law.  The rights hereunder shall be contract rights and shall include the right to be paid expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer of the Foundation in his capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is tendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Foundation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it should be determined ultimately by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this section or otherwise.

__10.2 Right of Claimant to Bring Suit.__ If a claim under Section 10.1 is not paid in full by the Foundation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Foundation, or twenty (20) days in the case of a claim for advancement of expenses, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Foundation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if such suit is not frivolous or brought in bad faith, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim.  It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any, has been tendered to this Foundation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the Delaware Corporate Law to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed.  Neither the failure of the Foundation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its Members) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware Corporate Law, nor an actual determination by the Foundation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its Members) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.  In any suit brought by the Foundation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Foundation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Delaware Corporate Law.  In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Foundation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, shall be on the Foundation.

__10.3 Indemnification of Employees and Agents.__ The Foundation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and to the advancement of related expenses, to any employee or agent of the Foundation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article X with respect to the indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors and officers of the Foundation.

__10.4 Non-Exclusivity of Rights.__ The rights conferred on any person in this Article X shall not be exclusive of any other right which such persons may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of Members or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

__10.5 Indemnification Contracts.__ The Board of Directors is authorized to enter into a contract with any director, officer, employee or agent of the Foundation, or any person serving at the request of the Foundation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including employee benefit plans, providing for indemnification rights equivalent to or, if the Board of Directors so determines, greater than, those provided for in this Article X.

__10.6 Insurance.__ The Foundation shall maintain insurance to the extent reasonably available, at its expense, to protect itself and any such director, officer, employee or agent of the Foundation or another Foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Foundation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware Corporate Law.

__10.7 Effect of Amendment.__ Any amendment, repeal, or modification of any provision of this Article X shall not adversely affect any right or protection of an indemnitee or his successor in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment, repeal, or modification.
